## This is a learning project repo focused on building Confidence, where u get to take a look at how I approach a problem statement
### Here are the rules that I follow 

#### Rule 1:- Take a dataset and look for a problem statement ( u can use chatgpt/any llms to give you a problem statement on the specific data u took) i chose kaggle competitions , uc irvine datasets ( will keep updating where i find my problem statements from ) 

#### Rule 2:- Sit down on the data and think about how u could get the solution 

#### Rule 3:- Once done with the approach start building the solution and wherever u get stuck take a video / search up in llms / google and figure out how to do it & how u could handle the problem and note them down make the changes

#### Rule 4:- Continue this process until u are done with your project 

### MOST IMPORTANT RULE 

#### Rule 5:- Review your project and look at YouTube/forums/communities where you might find things related to your project and understand what type of mistakes u might have done, note them down next time and use it to make a better project and this is how u build a habit in making sure u are confident with whole process 


#### This introduces the necessity for you to understand and implement your project to your best giving you the means to achieve confidence 

pretty much great way to learn
