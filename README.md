## This is a learning project repo focused on building Confidence, where u get to take a look at how I approach a problem statement

### Here are the rules that I follow 

### _**Rule 1**_ :- ### Take a dataset and look for a problem statement ( u can use chatgpt/any llms to give you a problem statement on the specific data u took) i chose kaggle competitions , uc irvine datasets ( will keep updating where i find my problem statements from ) 

### _**Rule 2**_ :- ### Sit down on the data and think about how u could get the solution 

### _**Rule 3**_ :- ### Once done with the approach start building the solution and wherever u get stuck take a video / search up in llms / google and figure out how to do it & how u could handle the problem and note them down make the changes

### _**Rule 4**_ :- ### Continue this process until u are done with your project 

## MOST IMPORTANT RULE 

### _**Rule 5**_ :- ### Review your project and look at YouTube/forums/communities where you might find things related to your project and understand what type of mistakes u might have done, note them down next time and use it to make a better project and this is how u build a habit in making sure u are confident with whole process 


## This introduces the necessity for you to understand and implement your project to your best giving you the means to achieve confidence 

pretty much great way to learn
